Fillit is a project which involves discovering and getting acquainted with a recurrent problem in programming: the search of an optimal solution among a very large number of possibilities in a reasonable amount of time. In this project, you will arrange Tetriminos among them and determine the smallest square that can fit all of them.

# Compailing
run `make` or `make emoji`, an executable `fillit`or `fillit_emoji` should compile.

# Usage
usage: `./fillit source_file`

### Programs output
`./fillit` print with using alphabet starting from A to Z.

`./fillit_emoji` prints result with emojies.
